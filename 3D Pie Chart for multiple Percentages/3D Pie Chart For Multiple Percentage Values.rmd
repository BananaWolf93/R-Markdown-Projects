```{r, Pie-Chart}

# The following code chunk is designed to render a 3D pie chart using percentages extracted from a specific column using different values that are NOT numeric. 
# For example, wanting to figure out what percentage of rows or items have a certain value in the targeted column. Using all values will provide accurate results.

# This first section installs and loads the library needed for this 3D pie chart.

install.packages(plotrix)
library(plotrix)

# The next section defined and reads the data from the name of the dataset down to the column applicable to this chart template.

dataset <- "ENTER-THE-DATASET-FILE.XLSX"
sheet_name <-"ENTER-THE-NAME-OF-SHEET-IF-APPLICABLE"
data <- read_excel(data, sheet_name)
data_column <- data$"ENTER-COLUMN-NAME"

# The next section rounds the percentage for items that have the specified column values. This example uses 3 different column values.

percentage_val1 <- round(mean(data_column == "ENTER-COLUMN-VALUE1", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 2)
percentage_val2 <- round(mean(data_column == "ENTER-COLUMN-VALUE2", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 2)
percentage_val3 <- round(mean(data_column == "ENTER-COLUMN-VALUE3", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, 2)

# The next few lines of code focuses on defining appropriate labeling for the pie chart.

percentage_result1 <- paste("ENTER-LABEL", percentage_val1, "%")
percentage_result2 <- paste("ENTER-LABEL", percentage_val2, "%")
percentage_result3 <- paste("ENTER-LABEL", percentage_val3, "%")

# The next line of code creates a dedicated matrix for the 3 labels for the pie chart which is then used in the pie3D code at the bottom. These values are adjusted to determine the position of the labels.

label_positions <- matrix(c(1.0, 9.0, 12.1))

# The next section creates a vector using all percentage objects to simplify the usage of them for both their values and labels in the pie chart.

Combined_perc <- c(percentage_val1, percentage_val2, percentage_val3)
lbls <- c(percentage_result1, percentage_result2, percentage_result3)

# Finally, the pie chart is then created using the two previously defined vectors, assigns colors per value in the vector, and assigns a name for the chart.

pie3D(Combined_perc, labels = lbls, radius = 1.8, shade = 0.2, labelpos = label_positions, explode = 0.3, col = c("green", "orange", "red"), main = "ENTER-THE-NAME-OF-YOUR-CHART")
